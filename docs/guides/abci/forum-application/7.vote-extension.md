# Vote Extensions

**In this section you will learn how a node can `ExtendVote` and `VerifyVote` on the forum application.**

## ExtendVote

In ABCI++, the `ExtendVote` method allows applications to extend the pre-commit vote with arbitrary data. This allows applications to force their validators to do more than just validate blocks within consensus.

When a validator is preparing to send a `pre-commit` vote, it first calls `ExtendVote.` The application then returns a blob of data called a `vote extension.` This data is opaque to the consensus algorithm but can contain application-specific information.

The validator then sends both the `pre-commit` vote and the `vote extension` together to other validators. Other validators also call `ExtendVote` to generate their own `vote extensions.`

When a validator receives a `pre-commit` vote with an attached `vote extension`, it calls `VerifyVoteExtension` to validate the `vote extension.` If valid, the validator includes the vote in its tally.

The proposer of the next block will receive all `vote extensions` in `RequestPrepareProposal.`
This allows validators to have access to all vote extensions at the next height. They can then use the data in the `vote extensions` to inform the transactions that make it into the next block.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `ExtendVote` function:**

```go
func (app ForumApp) ExtendVote(_ context.Context, extendvote *abci.RequestExtendVote) (*abci.ResponseExtendVote, error) {
  return &abci.ResponseExtendVote{VoteExtension: []byte(app.CurseWords)}, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

`ExtendVote` function takes two parameters: a `context.Context` and a pointer to an abci.`RequestExtendVote` struct. It returns a pointer to an `abci.ResponseExtendVote` struct and an error.

The method implementation simply returns a new instance of `abci.ResponseExtendVote` with the `VoteExtension` field set to the value of `app.CurseWords.` The `app.CurseWords` is expected to be a byte array containing the vote extension data.

The `abci.ResponseExtendVote` struct is used to encapsulate the response data for the `ExtendVote` method. By setting the `VoteExtension` field, the method includes the application-specific vote extension data in the response.

In this implementation, the `ExtendVote` method in the ForumApp application returns the application-specific `vote extension` data stored in the `app.CurseWords` variable.

*Tip: The `vote extensions` are opaque to the consensus algorithm but visible to the application, allowing for a variety of use cases like **price oracles, encrypted mempools, and threshold cryptography.***

## VerifyVoteExtension

In ABCI++, the `ExtendVote` method allows applications to extend the pre-commit vote with arbitrary data. This allows applications to force their validators to do more than just validate blocks within consensus.

When a validator is preparing to send a `pre-commit` vote, it first calls `ExtendVote.` The application then returns a blob of data called a `vote extension.` This data is opaque to the consensus algorithm but can contain application-specific information.

The validator then sends both the `pre-commit` vote and the `vote extension` together to other validators. Other validators also call `ExtendVote` to generate their own `vote extensions.`

When a validator receives a `pre-commit` vote with an attached `vote extension`, it calls `VerifyVoteExtension` to validate the `vote extension.` If valid, the validator includes the vote in its tally.

The proposer of the next block will receive all `vote extensions` in `RequestPrepareProposal.`
This allows validators to have access to all vote extensions at the next height. They can then use the data in the `vote extensions` to inform the transactions that make it into the next block.

In ABCI++, the `VerifyVoteExtension` method allows applications to verify the `VoteExtension` data attached to each `pre-commit` message. Here's how it works:

When a validator is preparing to send a `pre-commit` vote, it first calls `ExtendVote` to generate a `VoteExtension.` This `VoteExtension` is broadcast along with the `pre-commit` vote.

Other validators also call `ExtendVote` to generate their own `vote extensions.` However, not all validators will generate the same `vote extension.`

When a validator receives a `pre-commit` vote with an attached `vote extension`, it calls `VerifyVoteExtension` to validate the `vote extension.`

If the vote extension is successfully verified, the `pre-commit` vote is included in the tally. If validation fails, the entire `pre-commit` message is ignored.

**Following is the blurb of code for the `ExtendVote` function:**

```go
func (app ForumApp) ExtendVote(_ context.Context, extendvote *abci.RequestExtendVote) (*abci.ResponseExtendVote, error) {
  return &abci.ResponseExtendVote{VoteExtension: []byte(app.CurseWords)}, nil
}
```

**Explanation of code:**

`ExtendVote` function takes two parameters: a `context.Context` and a pointer to an abci.`RequestExtendVote` struct. It returns a pointer to an `abci.ResponseExtendVote` struct and an error.

The method implementation simply returns a new instance of `abci.ResponseExtendVote` with the `VoteExtension` field set to the value of `app.CurseWords.` The `app.CurseWords` is expected to be a byte array containing the vote extension data.

The `abci.ResponseExtendVote` struct is used to encapsulate the response data for the `ExtendVote` method. By setting the `VoteExtension` field, the method includes the application-specific vote extension data in the response.

In this implementation, the `ExtendVote` method in the ForumApp application returns the application-specific `vote extension` data stored in the `app.CurseWords` variable.

*Tip: Verified vote extensions can be persisted by the application. For example, the application could store data derived from the vote extensions.*
