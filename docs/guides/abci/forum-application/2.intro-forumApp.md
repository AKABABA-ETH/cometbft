# Forum Application

In this tutorial, we will build a forum application using `ABCI++`. We will demonstrate the use of `ABCI++` functions like - `CheckTx`, `PrepareProposal`, `ProcessProposal`, `FinalizeBlock` and `VoteExtension`

## What does the application do?

**Forum application** accepts `sender` and `message` as input and checks if the `sender` has been `banned` or not. If the `sender` is banned, it cannot send a message on forum.
If the `sender` is not banned, the `message` is checked for any curse words. If the `message` contains curse words, the `sender` is banned. If not, message is persisted to DB.

*Note: Curse words are defined in genesis, a copy of which is available with all nodes. To add a new curse word, the node must use `VoteExtension.`*

Here is an example of how directory structure of the tutorial can be defined.

- `abci`
    - `app.go`
    - `config.go`
    - `state.go`
    - `util.go`
- `model`
    - `db.go`
    - `messages.go`
    - `user.go`
- `config/config.go`
- `config/config.toml`
- `main.go`
