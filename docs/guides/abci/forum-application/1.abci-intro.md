# Introduction to ABCI++

`ABCI++` is an evolution of ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) from Cometbft. It acts as an interface between Cometbft (a state machine replication engine) and the actual state machine being replicated (i.e. the application).

## ABCI++ Functions

### PrepareProposal

The PrepareProposal method processes a list of transactions and filters out any transactions that contain curse words while adding a ban transaction for messages with curse words.

### ProcessProposal

The ProcessProposal method validates and executes the proposed block, which is called by the state replication engine.

### ExtendVote

The ExtendVote method extends the voting period of the block proposal, allowing more time for validators to vote on the proposed block.

### VerifyVoteExtension

The VerifyVoteExtension method verifies the validity of the vote extension proposed by a node, ensuring it meets the necessary criteria.

### FinalizeBlock

The FinalizeBlock method finalizes the state changes made during block processing and prepares them for persistence.

### Commit

The Commit method persists the finalized state changes to a durable storage system, ensuring the changes are retrievable later.
